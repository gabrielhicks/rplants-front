        "light": "African Violet plants do best and flower more in bright indirect light, close to an east-facing window is ideal. When the light is too low, the leaves turn dark green, lose their plump appearance, and the plant produces very few flowers. The leaves turn a pale yellow-green and the flowers fade quickly when there is too much light.",
        "water": "Allow the top 1-2 inches of soil to dry out before watering. Avoid using water that has passed through a softener or water containing chlorine or fluorine. Always water African Violet houseplants from the bottom to prevent water getting on the leaves. Remove any excess water that is still in the saucer after 15 minutes.",
        "fertilizer": "Special fertilizer for African Violet plants is available wherever plants are sold. In a pinch, you can use any balanced, soluble, houseplant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Feed African Violets monthly when the plant is actively growing. Over-fertilizing causes leaf tip burn, poor flower production, leaf cracks, and may even kill an African Violet plant.",
        "temperature": "These plants do well in temperatures of 75°-80°F (23.9°-26.7C) during the day and about 10° cooler at night. Keep African Violet plants away from cold drafts and heating vents.",
        "humidity": "High humidity is preferable, but African Violets easily adapt to basic household humidity."

        "light": "ZZ plants can survive in low light, but grow faster in bright, indirect light. Since a ZZ plant is a slow grower even in good light, in low light these plants rarely produces new leaves. Direct sun may fade and burn the leaves. Stems droop over when there is not enough light and grow straight up when light is coming from above.",
        "water": "Over-watering is the main way to kill a ZZ plant. They do not like wet feet, so allow the soil to dry out before watering. Unlike most plants, Zamioculcas are very forgiving, allowing you to over-water a few times before showing signs of serious damage. Yellow leaves are an indication that the plant has been over-watered or severely under-watered. In very warm weather, a ZZ plant may need water every 7-10 days. In cooler weather, the plant may go 2-3 weeks before drying out. When you do water, water well enough so that the water comes out the drip holes in the bottom of the pot.",
        "fertilizer": "Feed monthly when a ZZ plant is actively producing new leaves and every other month when it is not in a growing phase. Use a balanced, liquid plant food diluted to 1/2 the recommended strength. Too much plant food causes yellow leaves; this is called nutrient burn.",
        "temperature": "A Zamioculcas zamiifolia plant prefers temperatures between 60°-80°F (15.6°-26.7°C). Temperatures below 60°F (16.6°C) slow down the plant's growth.",

The lighter the color in the leaves, the more light a plant requires.",
        "water": "Water well and then allow the top 50% of the soil to dry out before watering again. Over-watering is the main reason a pothos plant dies. Bright yellow leaves indicate that the soil has gotten too dry before you watered it. New growth and older leaves turn pale yellow and may get black spots on the leaves when a pothos is over- watered.",
