        "light": "A miniature rose bush plant needs very bright light. If you don’t have a place in your home where the plant can get several hours of direct sun, move the rose bush outdoors into the sun for a few hours each day once the danger of a frost is over. When there is not enough light, rose bushes don’t bloom, the stems start to stretch to the light, and leaves are far apart.",
        "water": "This plant requires a great deal of water. Since these plants are usually purchased in small pots, be sure to check the soil every few days. Allow the top 1” (2.5cm) of soil to dry out before watering. During the winter, when a miniature rose bush plant is resting, keep the soil barely moist. Be careful not to get water on the leaves; wet leaves often cause a fungus called Black Spot to develop.",
        "fertilizer": "Feed every two weeks in the spring and summer when the plant is actively growing. Use a fertilizer that is high in phosphorous (5-10-5) at ½ the recommended strength.",
        "temperature": "Miniature rose bush plants do well in temperatures between 60°-75°F (16°-24°C). These plants are very susceptible to frost damage.",
        "humidity": "Moderate to high humidity helps the plant to grow well. If your home is dry, especially in the winter, place a miniature rose bush plant on a tray of wet pebbles. Be sure the plant is sitting on the pebbles and not in the water."

        "pet_friendly": false,
        "light": "Poinsettia Plants need very bright indirect light but no direct sun. The light from a north- facing window is really not adequate for a Poinsettia Plant. If you place your Poinsettia Plant close to a window, be sure none of the leaves touch the glass or the cold will damage them.",
        "water": "Poinsettia Plants are members of the Euphorbia family and should not be over- watered. Always allow the top 50% of the soil to dry out before watering to prevent root rot. Over-watering a Poinsettia Plant causes green leaves to fall off, leaving bare stems topped by a few colorful bracts. Severe under-watering, in which a Poinsettia Plant badly droops, results in both green and colored leaves dropping off",
        "fertilizer": "Fertilize a Poinsettia Plant monthly in the spring and summer after the plant has finished blooming.",
        "temperature": "Temperature is a very important factor in Poinsettia Plant care. Poinsettia Plants last longer and look better when the temperature is between 65-70 degrees during the day and around 60 degrees at night. Temperatures that are too hot or too cold damage Poinsettia Plant leaves and may cause leaf drop.",
        "humidity": "A Poinsettia Plant does well in basic household humidity."
